# memorygame

This game is created as part of Udacity's nanodegree Memory Game project assignment. It is created using HTML, CSS and JS. 

In this game the player will click on cards and find matching pairs. 

To play the game click on two cards at a time. If the cards match they will remain open. If they don't they will close. The game starts with a 3 star rating and as the number of moves goes up the rating goes down. There is also a timer that counts up and the game tracks the number of moves made. When all the matching cards are found a modal pop-up will display the final star rating, total time and moves it took to complete the game.
